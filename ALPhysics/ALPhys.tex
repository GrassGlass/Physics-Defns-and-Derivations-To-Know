\chapter{Kinematics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Distance} is defined as the total length of \emph{path} travelled.
    \item \textit{Velocity} is defined as the rate of change of displacement.
    \item \textit{Acceleration} is defined as the rate of change of velocity.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Dynamics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Newton's First Law of Motion} states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will remain in motion at constant velocity in a straight line in the absence of an \emph{external} resultant force.
    \item The \textit{linear momentum} of a body is the product of its mass and velocity. The linear momentum is in the \emph{same direction} as it velocity.
    \item \textit{Newton's Second Law of Motion} states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the resultant force acting on the body and occurs \emph{in the direction} of the resultant force.
    \item \textit{Newton's Third Law of Motion} states that if body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force of the \emph{same type} that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on body A.
    \item \textit{Impulse} is defined as the product of \emph{average} force acting on an object and the time for which the force acts.
    \item The \textit{Principle of Conservation of Linear Momentum} states that the total momentum of a system remains constant provided no \emph{external} resultant force acts on the system.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Forces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Hooke's Law} states that the force is directly proportional to the extension in a material if its \emph{limit of proportionality} is not exceeded.
    \item The \textit{centre of gravity} of an object is the point at which the entire weight of a body may be considered to act.
    \item The \textit{moment} of a force is equal to the product of the force and the \emph{perpendicular} distance of the \emph{line of action} of the force from the pivot. It is also the turning effect of a force.
    \item \textit{Torque of a couple} is defined as the product of one of the forces and the \emph{perpendicular} distance between the \emph{lines of action} of the forces.
    \item The \textit{Principle of Moments} states that if a body is in equilibrium, the sum of all the clockwise moments about \emph{any axis} must be equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about the \emph{same axis}.
    \item \textit{Density} is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance.
    \item \textit{Pressure} is defined as force per unit area, where the force is \emph{acting perpendicularly} to the area.
    \item Deriving \(p=\rho gh\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider a point at a depth \(h\) below the surface of a liquid of density \(\rho\). 
        \item The force \(F\) acting perpendicularly on a surface area \(A\) at depth \(h\) is due to the weight of the liquid column above \(A\) to give pressure \(p\). Thus, \(p=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{mg}{A}=\frac{\rho Ah}{g}=\rho gh\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Upthrust} is the upward force exerted by a fluid on a body immersed in the fluid (due to pressure difference in the fluid).
    \item \textit{The origin of upthrust:} Upthrust is a result of the pressure difference between top and bottom surfaces of the body, resulting in a net upwards force being exerted on the body by the third medium in which the body is located.
    \item \textit{Archimedes' Principle} states that when a body is totally or partially immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward force (upthrust) equal to the weight of fluid displaced.
    \item \textit{The Principle of Floatation} states that, for any object floating in \emph{equilibrium}, the upthrust is equal to the weight of the object.
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Work, Energy, and Power}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Work done} is defined as the product of a force and the displacement in the direction of the force.
    \item \textit{One joule of work} is defined as the work done by a force of 1 Newton when its \emph{point of application} moves through a distance of 1 metre in the direction of the force.
    \item \textit{Energy} is defined as the ability to do work.
    \item \textit{The Principle of Conservation of Energy} states that energy can neither be created or destroyed in \emph{any process}. It can be transformed from one form to another, and transferred from one body to another.
    \item Deriving \(E_k=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\): 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider a constant horizontal applied force \(F\) acting on an object of mass \(m\) travelling with initial velocity \(u\) to reach a final velocity \(v\) over a displacement \(s\). 
        \item For uniform acceleration, \(v^2=u^2+2as\) so \(as=\frac{1}{2}(v^2-u^2)\). Combined with Newton's Second Law, \(W=Fs=mas=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2\). When the object starts from rest, \(u=0\). 
        \item By conservation of energy,\emph{ the work done by force \(F\) must be converted into the kinetic energy \(E_k\) of the object}. Hence, \(E_k=W=\frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}m(0)^2=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The \textit{Work-Energy Theorem} states that the net work done by \emph{external} forces acting on a particle is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the particle.
    \item Deriving \(E_p=mgh\):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Consider an object from the Earth's surface --- which is taken as the reference for zero gravitational potential energy --- raised up by a \emph{constant force \(F\) equal to and opposite to the weight \(mg\)} of the object such that the object moves up at \emph{constant velocity} to a height \(h_2\). 
        \item Thus, the object moves at constant speed so \(\Delta E_k=0\). Therefore, 
        \begin{align*}
            \Delta E_p&= W\\
            E_p-0&=Fs\\
            E_p&=mgh.
        \end{align*}
        Where \(E_p\) is the gravitational potential energy at height \(h\) above the Earth's surface.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Know how to \(\Delta E_p=\frac{1}{2}kx^2\) from area under graph.
    \item \textit{Power} is defined as the rate of doing work.
    \item Derive \(P=Fv\): \(P=\frac{\text{d}W}{\text{d}t}=\frac{F\text{d}s}{\text{d}t}=Fv\).
\end{itemize}
\chapter{Temperature and Ideal Gases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textit{Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics} If bodies \(A\) and \(B\) are separately in thermal equilibrium with body \(C\), then bodies \(A\) and \(B\) are in thermal equilibrium with each other.
    \item \textit{One mole} is defined as the amount of substance that contains as many elementary particles as there are atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.
    \item \textit{Avogadro's Constant \(N_A\)} is the number of atoms in 0.012kg of carbon-12.

    \item A \textit{freely oscillating} system oscillates at its own \textit{natural frequency} without \emph{external} influences other than the \emph{initial impulse when displaced} from its equilibrium position, with \emph{no dissipation} of energy.
    \item \textit{Damped oscillations} are oscillations in which the amplitude diminishes with time as a result of \emph{dissipative forces} that reduce the total energy of the oscillations.
    \item A system is in \textit{forced oscillations} when it is forced to oscillate at a frequency other than the natural frequency by a \emph{periodic external} force.
    \item \textit{Resonance} is a phenomenon that occurs when the frequency at which an object is being made to vibrate (the forced frequency of vibration) is equal equal to its natural frequency of vibration.

\chapter{Superposition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Principle of Superposition}: When two or more waves of the \emph{same type}, meet at \emph{a point in space}, the \emph{resultant displacement} of the waves at any point is the \emph{vector sum} of the \emph{displacements} due to \emph{each wave acting independently} at that point.
    \item \emph{Stationary waves} are waves whose \emph{waveforms does not advance} and there is \emph{no net translation of energy}. The \emph{amplitude} of the waves varies according to \emph{position} from zero at the nodes to a maximum at the antinodes.
    \item A stationary wave is formed when two \emph{progressive} waves
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Having the \emph{same frequency} and \emph{same speed}
        \item Travel in \emph{opposite directions} towards each other
        \item Have \emph{similar amplitudes}
        \item Are unpolarised, or polarised along the same axis
